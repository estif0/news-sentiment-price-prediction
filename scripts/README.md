# Scripts Directory

This directory contains utility scripts for data processing, utilites and project maintenance tasks.

## Purpose

Scripts in this directory are designed for:

-   **Data Processing**: ETL pipelines, data cleaning, and preprocessing
-   **Utilities**: Helper functions, data validation, and maintenance scripts

## Current Status

🚧 **Under Development**: Scripts will be added as the project progresses through Tasks 2 and 3.

## Usage

```bash
# Run scripts from project root
python scripts/script_name.py

# Or make executable and run directly
chmod +x scripts/script_name.py
./scripts/script_name.py
```

## Development Guidelines

-   Use `src/core/` modules for reusable functionality
-   Include argument parsing for flexible script execution
-   Add logging for monitoring and debugging
-   Document script parameters and expected outputs
